for diffusivity calculation ! using "md_md.rst" as restart file
 &cntrl 
  imin=0, ! no need to minimize
  irest=1, ! restart from the last .rst file
  ntx=5, ! read the coordinates and speed
  ntb=1, ! use constant volume periodic boundaries to turn on PME
  cut=10.0, ! doundary cutoff is 10 Angstrom
  ntc=2, ! bonds involving hydrogen have length constrained by SHAKE
  ntf=2, ! same as ntc
  ntt=0, ! constant total energy, key part of NVE simulation
  nstlim=20000, ! 20ps simulation
  dt=0.001, ! time step as 1fs
  ntpr=200, ! print information in mdinfo every 200 steps
  ntwx=200, ! write coordinates in mdcrd file every 0.2 ps
  ntwr=200, ! write rst file every 200 steps
  ioutfm=1, ! output trajectory is in NETCDF format
  lj1264=1, ! turn on 1264 force field
